/*
JSGF Grammar file for Hue commands.
This is very helpful, because it helps sort out noise or conversation
that you don't want to process.

For example in the huecommand rule, the double set of parenthesis
requires one word in the first set to be followed by a word in the
second set. It won't just take a single word. Very helpful
